Algorithm
• Algorithm is a step by step process for solving a computational problem
• programming is also same however , algorithms is something we write first
before converting it (solution) into a program so, that our machines can
understand it.
• The procedure used for solving various problems are called algorithm
• Pseudo code is something which can be written in any language (programming
, syntax or pure English ) this is used just for understanding algorithm
Ex of algorithm:
Algorithm Average( List , n )
{
Sun <- 0;
For each element x in list
Begin
Sum <- sum + x;
End;
Avg <- sum/n;
Return avg;
}
