                             Steps Involve in the Development & Execution of program

• The main steps involved in the development and execution of a program are
1. Editing
2. Compiling
3. Linking Libraries
4. Loading
5. Execution

• Editing

- Editing can be done on any text editor / Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) so, that all the above steps can be done at one place.

• Compiling

- Compiler will convert the source code into a machine code if there are no errors
in the program

• Linking Libraries

- For various operations build in functions / classes are available in c++ that are
present in the header files supported by libraries where machine code is readily
available to use

• Loading

- For running the program it should be brought into the main memory from the
hard disk for getting it executed this is called LOADING

• Execution

- Once the code is in the main memory OS will ask the CPU to execute the
program thus the execution process starts.
